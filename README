Build instructions for Mac/Ubuntu, the only difference is which m_<mac/unix> to use

From where you want the pNXT directory to be made:
1) git clone https://github.com/jl777/pNXT
2) cd pNXT/src
3) cmake ..
4) ./m_mac or ./m_unix (you might have to chmod +x <filename)
5) src/pNXTd

That should be it!
