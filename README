Build instructions for Mac/Ubuntu, the only difference is which m_<mac/unix> to use.

From where you want the pNXT directory to be made:
1) git clone https://github.com/jl777/pNXT
2) cd pNXT/src
3) cmake ..

You need to get libuv.a libwebsockets.a libnacl.a randombytes.o into the pNXT/src/src directory
I have made precompiled versions of these and put them into macosx.zip and ubuntu.zip, respectively
The m_mac and m_unix scripts will unzip these into the pNXT/src/src directory, but if you dont want to use
the precompiled version, just make your own and put the four files there. As long as they are more recent
than what is in the zip file, it wont get overwritten. (touch *.a *.o will do the trick if you want to use older
pre-builts that you already have)

4) ./m_mac or ./m_unix 
5) src/pNXTd

It took all weekend to get it to compile nice and happy, hopefully it works for you!

P.S. I put a self-contained subset of NXTservices right into the pNXT source tree so everything needed should be there
